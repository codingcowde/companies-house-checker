    <h2> CHecker - Your Data Export </h2>
    <p> Hi there, <br> 
        Please, find in the attached file, which contains all we have about you. The field user contains your name while the email field hold your email address. 
        The flag is there to protect your inbox from overflow and keeps track if ten days have passed after your last received report. <br>
        <br>
        No joke, that is really it, as we do not store the data found about you and only keep it in memory till your report was send to you.<br>  
        For more on this, review our <a href="https://checker.codingcow.de#gdpr">privacy policy<a>. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        Kind regards, <br>
        The CHecker Team
