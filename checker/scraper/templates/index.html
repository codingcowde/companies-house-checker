                stored in memory.<br>
                <br><b>Important:</b>
                <br> Please, make sure to provide your full name, as we are checking for officer appointments by name.

            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>


            <p>
                A short explanation on how we process the data you trusted us with, and how you can excercise your
                rights
                to controll your data.
            </p>

            <h4>What we save and where.</h4>
            <p>
                We will save your name and contact email in order to provide this service. Your Data is stored in a
                UK based Datacenter under responsibility of codingcow.de.
                Results are only stored temporarily (in RAM), in order to provide them to you.
                As these results are basically a result of a web search, we will rather search again
                than saving more data as needed. Whenever you receive a new result, you can choose to unsubscribe.
                This will also delete all your results from our systems.
            </p>

            <h4>Will you give my information to 3rd parties?</h4>
            <p>
                Your name will only be provided to the company house, when doing the request. Your email will never be
                shared and is only used to send you any
                information we can find in the Companies House register and to send you your data export.
                We will not user your data for any not mentioned purposes and won't provide or sell to any 3rd party not
                mentioned on this page.
            </p>
            <h4>How to unsubscribe?</h4>
            <p>
                You can unsubscribe on the same page you subscribed to the service, by simply entering your email
                address and click the "Bye!" button. Your data will be deleted as soon as you are
                unsubscribed.
            </p>
            <h4>How to delete my data?</h4>
            <p>
                When you unsubscribe, your data will be deleted.
            </p>


            <h4>How to download my data?</h4>
            <p>
                You can request a complete set of all data we stored about you, from the landing page by clicking the
                "Request" button in the data export form.
            </p>
            <h4> Where is your Cookie Banner? </h4>
            <p>
                No Cookies, no Banner. See your Browser settings, you won't find even a crumble.
            </p>
            <h4>How much will you charge me and when?</h4>
            <p>
                This service is free for everyone. If you feel bad about it, or you just want to buy us a coffee,
